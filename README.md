# Advent-Of-Code2020
Personal solutions to AoC 2020 problems (https://adventofcode.com/)

Day 1 (Python):
- Hashing algorithms for 2SUM and 3SUM problems

Day 2 (C++):
- Split each line into components and check the password

Day 3 (Python):
- Simulating the movement and then checking every position (you don't need to copy the map to the right, the modulo operator makes it easier and you only need a copy of the map)

Day 4 (Python):
- Awful string splitting and checking each property of the passport

Day 5 (C):
- You can look at each of the seat codes like a binary number. Using bitwise operators, you get the position of each code. (For part 2 you also need a hashing table.)
